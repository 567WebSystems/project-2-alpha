# *Just Do It!* - Progress Report One

## What we've done:

We've written the topic post.

Seriously, our team had many discussions on the project topic. Basically, everyone wanted to pursue their own idea. After continuous debate and careful consideration of the Professor's feedback, it was decided to go with the best shaped project: an appointment-scheduling calendar system with Google integration. Some may view this topic as limited in scope and features — that is the point! Team-members also agreed it is a very in-demand organizer which has versatile applications in the industry. Every business large and small needs to schedule events at some point in time. Why not use an online platform to schedule appointments?

Other things we completed included setting up a Team Drive, Slack Workspace, Hangouts Chat, and Github Organization.  We have now enabled Github notifications in Slack, so we are all caught up with each and every commit. All of us met on Hangouts face-to-face, and before and after class sessions. We started planning with sketches and drive documents, to better shape the contents of our project topic.

## What we're doing:

We’re making commits on Github across markdown documents. We have this progress report and project topic file on our team organization. We are getting ready for the upcoming weeks.

## What we're going to do:

Look for data APIs to access user and calendar information. Decide on languages, frameworks and other developer tools to help complete this project. We are confident in the standard scripting language lineup (HTML, CSS, JS) for the front-end. However we are not sure about the back-end tools we should use. Python, C++, Go, or something else? Which of these is best suited for our project needs? Perhaps there is a better programming language or framework to look into for the back-end?  

We would like to give user appointment updates via their google systems. Perhaps they could receive email notifications about their appointments, if they so wish. We also need to write out this type of information on Trello, not necessarily as assigned tasks but more for managing the overall project objectives.
